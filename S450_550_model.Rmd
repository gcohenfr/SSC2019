## Overview

- **STAT450: Case Studies in Statistics**
  - real case study
  
  - statistics & computational & communication

  
- **STAT550: Techniques for Statistical Consulting**
  - early involvement in Consulting
  
  - statistics & computational & communication
  - mentoring and/or supervisory role
  
- **A joint model: real consulting project**
  - gains
  
  - challenges

## STAT450: Case Studies in Statistics
**Learning Objectives:**

- understand how the data was collected 

- organize the data in a way that can be analyzed

- analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods 

- interpret the results 
- present and communicate the results

###<font color=red>Real Case Studies </font>
- from graduate students and research faculty in other disciplines

- from collaborators
- from agancies and units (inside and outside UBC)

### Statistical Consulting Experience

 - **understand the "client's" question** 
 
 - **understand the context of the study**

<font color=grey>
- understand how the data was collected 

- organize the data in a way that can be analyzed

- analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods

- **present and communicate the results**

- ###This process is NOT linear!!

## Most Statistics Programs

<font color=grey>
 - understand the "client's" question
 
 - understand the context of the study

<font color=black>
- **understand how the data was collected**

## Challenge
 - Not all students are ready to handle a real analysis
 
  - Statistical methodology
 
  - Computational literacy
 
  - Communication skills

##Features of the course:

- to put in **real practice** the methodologies learned in the program 

- to learn new methodology as required by the goals of the study 

- to experience a **full** and **open-ended** data analysis process 

- to build collaborative relationships with peers


---
## Building a collaborative model
- Students work in groups of 2-4

- (If possible) each group works on a different case
- Each "client" meets with his/her group (at least) 3 times during the term:

  - **1st meeting**: introductions and presentation of case and data
  
  - **2nd meeting**: presentation of preliminary results
  
  - **3rd meeting**: poster session for presentation of final results

---
## Support: multiple  channels
- Each group is supervised by an instructor/TA

- Extra support to improve communication skills

- Many in-class and out-of-class discussions with the groups
- Weekly seminars to address statistical and computational challenges

## Is this enough??

- Probably not but expensive to get additional resourses

- Extremely time-consuming course for a single instructor 

- The progress of the case needs to match that of the term

## STAT550: Techniques for Statistical Consulting

**Objectives**
  - promote an early involvement in statistical consulting
  
  - promote collaborative and interdisciplinary work
  
  - expose students to real data challenges
  - help students to  
    - use and sharpen their statistical and computational skills
    
    - to improve their communication skills

    - to build a portfolio for future reference

## Our joint collaborative model

<img src="cohen_model.png" style="width: 95%" />
### STAT450: Case Studies in Statistics

### STAT550: Techniques for Statistical Consulting
- both classes work on a real data case study

- grad students mentor and supervised undergraduate students
- undergraduate students in-charge of most of the work

## Is this <font color=red>DATA SCIENCE </font>?
--

![Data Science](DS.jpg)
---
##Data Science 

### Not only **what** but also <font color=red>**how**</font> data analysis is conducted is relevant

--

 - transparent and reproducible workflow  
 
  - data aquisition 
  
  - data processing
  
  - data analysis
  
  - report of results
  
--

- open communication and discussions

  - combination of F2F meetings and online discussions
  
  - accessible to all group members
  
  - stored (e.g., by topic)

--

### <font color=red>**Can/Should**</font> this be accomplished in Consulting courses??

##Key componets of our model
<img src="cohen_model.png" style="width: 100%" />

### Each group collaborates through a GitHub/GitLab repository
- all relevant documents are version controlled (e.g., data, code, reports)

- issues are used for discussions (students also like Slack)

- can be easily transfered to the client at the end of the term

### Both classes meet regularly throught the term
---
##Key componets of our model (cont.)

### Transparent and reproducible analysis

- All coding is done in R

- Reports are drafted using RMarkdown reports (mandatory for the 1st report)

- https://github.com/gcohenfr/Sikkim

### Emphasis on communication
 - Group oral presentations
 
 - At least 3 drafts of the final written report are evaluated    
  - 1st report peer-evaluated by STAT550
 
 - Final results are presented in an open poster session
